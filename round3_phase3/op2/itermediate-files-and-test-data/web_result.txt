When Salman Khan makes a mistake, it is 'blown out of proportion', says filmmaker-actor Mahesh Manjrekar
"Salman is one guy who is ready to take the rap. He is ready to take the rap, the blame (on himself). He is human at the end of the day. Who doesn't make a mistake? I definitely make a mistake. But when he makes a mistake, it is blown out of proportion," actor-filmmaker Mahesh Manjrekar told PTI.
Manjrekar and Salman have worked together in films such as Wanted, Dabangg, Ready and Jai Ho among others.
"Salman is more than a friend to me. I don't know what transpired (in the case), the courts are there to decide. But today if you ask me what is your wish, I would say he should be released tomorrow. He doesn't deserve to be in jail. From two days my wife is asking me what is going to happen, and I am like, he will be out soon," he added.

Second post-mortem report of two blackbucks plays crucial role in Salman Khan's conviction
The second post-mortem report of the two blackbucks played a key role in proving that the animals had died of gunshots, as the trial court, while convicting Salman Khan, mentioned that it has been proved beyond doubt that the Bollywood superstar had shot them.
The medical board report stated that there were holes, one inch in diameter, in the bones of blackbuck carcasses and this could be caused by shots fired from a gun. Relying on this report, the trial court refused to admit the argument of the defense that the hole had been made by the investigator using a charred piece of coal just to establish the story of poaching and frame Salman in the case. - PTI  
It is up to the judge to decide if he wants to continue the hearing or not: lawyer Mahipal Bishnoi
Speaking to CNN-News18, lawyer Mahipal Bishnoi said that in case a judge is transferred, matters of urgent importance such as bail applications can be heard by the judge. But it also depends on the judge's discretion if he wants to continue hearing arguments.

'Getting death threats,' says Salman Khan's lawyer
"I am getting death threats. The message said 'Salman Khan ka case ko chodh dijiye, warna goli maarenge'," said Mahesh Bora, the convicted actor's lawyer. 
Salman Khan's sisters, bodyguard Shera reach Jodhpur court premises
Convicted actor Salman Khan's sisters and bodyguard Shera were seen entering the Jodhpur Sessions Court on Friday morning ahead of the Bollywood star's bail plea hearing at 10.30 am. 
Eyewitness account not reliable, Salman's defence lawyer tells Jodhpur court
News18 reported that Salman Khan's lawyer in the court argued that eyewitness Poonam Chand's account is not reliable. "Salman is paying the price for his celebrity status. Five-year jail term is too harsh," the lawyer reportedly said. 
Salman Khan's lawyer ready with 51-page bail application 
Qaidi 106 Salman Khan may have spent a night in the Jodhpur Central Jail but his lawyer is ready with a 51-page bail application where 54 grounds have been raised for the judge to consider and grant the convicted actor bail. Speaking to News18, lawyer Hastimal Saraswat said there are problems with Thursday's verdict which needs reconsideration. "If it was not Salman Khan, bail would have been granted the next day," said Saraswat.
Khan will be appealing in the Session Court on Friday, since the first right of appeal is yet to be exhausted. In case the bail is rejected, the Rajasthan High Court will be approached. 
Heavy security at Jodhpur jail, Salman Khan alone in cell
Security has been tightened in the Jodhpur Central Jail due to Salman Khan's presence. The actor has been kept alone in his cell, with nobody allowed to meet him, reported NDTV. He also has his own guards in jail. 
Crucial witness failed to identify Tabu, Sonali Bendre in court, resulting in their acquittal
It was during a cross examination in the blackbuck poaching case trial that a crucial witness and complainant Poonamchand Bishnoi failed to identify Tabu and Sonali Bendre in court, that helped in the actors' acquittal on Thursday, reported The Times of India. 
According to the report, defence counsel Shrikant Shivade produced Tabu and Sonali in court one day and asked Bishnoi to identify the two women. He couldn't do so. When the court asked Bishnoi why he couldn't identify them even though he named them in his complaint, he replied that their unassuming attire of white salwar-kameez confused him. This helped boost Shivade's case that Bishnoi was not at the site of the killing but 150 metres away from it. The defence also added it would have been impossible to recognise people in the vehicle's glare. 
Salman Khan has not eaten anything post-verdict
Quoting jail officials News18 reported that actor Salman Khan has not eaten anything after his verdict was announced and even refused to drink tea.
He was offered a cauliflower and potato vegetable dish, a pulse and a chappati, which he did not eat. He also did not drink the tea served to him. At present, he is wearing his own clothes, but will be given jail clothes once the jail store opens on Friday morning.  
Salman Khan's family likely to meet him today
According to India Today, the convicted actor's family will be allowed to meet him on Friday. His lawyers are free to meet him at anytime. 
Blackbuck population in Rajasthan has grown in last 20 years
Since actor Salman Khan was booked for killing two blackbuck in 1998, the endangered species population in Rajasthan has increased substantially in the last 20 years, reported The Indian Express. 
In 2007, the total number of blackbuck in the state stood at 14,701; in 2016, the number rose to 30,530 in 2016, as per the wildlife census of the Rajasthan forest department.

Updates for 6 April, 2017 begin here
Salman's lawyer issues statement, says 'we respect decision'
Salman's lawyer issued statement, "We respect the decision of the Hon'ble Court. While we are studying the judgement it just came as a surprise, as the entire investigation, and facts of this case were the same as those for which Salman has been acquitted by the Hon'ble High Court of Rajasthan in two cases, and even by the Hon'ble CJM in the Arms Act matter for the alleged offence on the very same night as is the subject matter of the present case. Also, in the present case, the Hon'ble Court has acquitted all the 5 co-accused which would imply that Salman was out hunting alone in the middle of the night in a remote area outside Jodhpur. We have preferred an appeal to the Hon'ble Sessions Court and applied for an urgent hearing today. The Hon'ble Sessions Court will hear the appeal for suspension of the sentence / bail at 1030 tomorrow."
Author Taslima Nasreen says "5 years imprisonment for killing black buck is too much."
Question on every mind is whether another great escape is round the corner
For years, we have watched him walk out, chest puffed with pride, after every court appearance. It is possible that the same circus may be repeated after his latest conviction for killing two black bucks in Jodhpur 20 years ago. Like in the past, his lawyers may knock on the doors of the High Court, seek bail and then let an appeal drag on. The questions on every mind, as this report is being typed are: how quickly will he get bail and will he actually serve the sentence? And we may again lament that an offender got away because of his clout and money.
Tight security measures in place around Salman's cell
As Salman entered Jodhpur Central Jail following the verdict a while ago, tight measures have been kept in place around the cell and the prison. As a Firstpost author says, "There is no bigger relief than to see convicts serve punishments they deserve. It not only establishes the rule of law, but also acts as a deterrent for society. If Khan manages to walk away again without serving his sentence, it would indeed be a travesty of justice."
One of the co-accused in the case, Neelam Kothari, returns to Mumbai
As co-accused Neelam Kothari returns to Mumbai, husband Sameer Soni says, "I am happy for us but disappointed for Salman. Justice has not been given properly in this case."

What actor's 5-year-jail sentence means for Bollywood
While Salman's immediate future isn't clear, what is certain is that Bollywood will suffer a dent in its economic activity when it pertains to projects the megastar is involved in. If the worst were to happen — meaning that Salman will have to serve his jail tenure — then it would be another blow to an industry that is already suffering under piracy, streaming services, and Hollywood superheroes. Salman now has four films lined up — namely, Race 3, Bharat, Kick 2 and Dabangg 3 — and a TV game show, Dus Ka Dum.
While Bharat, Kick 2, and Dabangg 3 are yet to go on the floors, Race 3 is on the verge of completion and only a small part of the shooting remains. The absence of Salman from the horizon of Bollywood for a period is bound to spell disaster for single screen theatres which look forward eagerly to his every release.
Why Saif Ali Khan, Tabu and others were let off
In the black buck poaching case, which has taken almost 20 years to come to a seeming conclusion, Salman was charged under Section 51 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act while the other actors were charged under Section 51 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act read with Section 149 (unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code. The reason behind the acquittal of the other stars may be because of the difficulty in furnishing any evidence linking Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre, Neelam and Tabu to the killing of the black bucks. Apart from Salman Khan, who was booked for killing an endangered species, the rest were charged with unlawful assembly.
No amenities for Salman in Jodhpur jail
Sources in Jodhpur Central Jail confirm that the room lacks all kinds of amenities. The actor has been kept in a cell close to that of Asaram bapu. There is definitely no cooler or AC and it is just like other simple prison cells.

Bishnoi eyewitness nailed the actor
The Bishnoi community continued the fight for 20 years and are celebrating the verdict. The perseverance and determination for the fight stems from the fact that the black buck is an integral part of the Bishnoi culture. While many may criticise the verdict as the court trying to set a strong precedence, the Bishnoi Sabha, which has been the primary complainant in this case, has also decided to appeal against the acquittal of the other four actors. The Bishnois, a prosperous and influential group residing primarily in Rajasthan, are unwilling to forget and forgive Salman for his alleged crimes, especially his acquittal in the chinkara poaching case.

Here are other Bollywood personalities who brushed with the law
Bollywood superstar Salman Khan, slapped with a five-year jail term for the Rajasthan blackbuck killing case — and now given bail — is one in a long list of film personalities who have had a serious brush with the law, grabbing headlines over the years.
Immediately prior to this, his friend and another "bhai" Sanjay Dutt virtually created history by becoming the first major film personality to be convicted and also one to complete his full jail sentence. Dutt was sentenced to five years by the Supreme Court for illegal possession of weapons after the bloody Mumbai communal carnage of Decemebr 1992-Januarry 1993 and its fallout in the form of the 12 March 1993 serial bomb blasts, India's biggest terror strike till date which left 257 dead.
In June 2009, Bollywood was shocked when actor Shiney Ahuja was arrested on charges of raping his maid-servant.
Actor Sooraj Pancholi, son of Bollywood actor-couple Aditya Pancholi and Zarina Wahab is embroiled in a case of abetment of suicide of British-American actress Jiah Khan, who was found dead at home in June 2013. The matter is in the courts.

The actor has already spent two nights in the Jodhpur Central Jail since he was convicted in the 1998 blackbuck poaching case on Thursday.
The prosecution on Saturday argued that Salman Khan's bail plea application should be rejected on the basis of eyewitness accounts, which they said proves the actor's guilt in killing two blackbucks in October 1998. The defense counsel, on the hand, argued that the eyewitness accounts are not true and filled with several discrepancies.

The defence and prosecution will present their arguments at 10.30 am on Saturday.
The magistrate Ravindra Kumar Joshi also sought the record of the case from the lower court.
In his arguments, defence counsel Mahesh Bora said there were various loopholes in the investigation. He argued that no investigation in any of the cases of poaching proved that Salman used firearms.
"We have argued that the eyewitness in the case was not reliable," Bora said, adding, "It was never proved that he had firearms. Even the pellets recovered from him did not corroborate the story of the prosecution. Also, the first post-mortem report was completely dumped."
"Besides this, he (Salman Khan) has been acquitted in all the other cases of poaching on the basis of the prosecution's failure to prove the allegations and in such a condition, his sentence should be suspended," he argued.
But objecting to the defence counsel's arguments, public prosecutor Pokar Ram Bishnoi urged the court to seek the record of the case from the trial court and go through it.
He argued that this was the only case where an eyewitness was available and the prosecution has succeeded in proving the crime beyond any doubt.
The actor is alleged to have shot and killed blackbucks in Kankani village near Jodhpur on the night of 1 October, 1998 during the shooting of the film "Hum Saath Saath Hain".
While convicting Salman, the trial court acquitted his Bollywood colleagues Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Neelam and Sonali Bendre and a local, Dushyant Singh, giving them the "benefit of doubt" for the incident in October 1998.
Meanwhile, the Bollywood star's sisters, Alvira and Arpita, met him in the jail. Later, Preity Zinta, who has acted with Salman Khan in several films, also paid him a visit.
According to jail superintendent Vikram Singh, Zinta visited Salman Khan in the afternoon. A meeting was arranged in the visitor's room, where they had a chat for about half an hour.

Fans and Bollywood celebrities rejoiced after actor Salman Khan on Saturday walked out of Jodhpur jail, where he spent two nights, following a sessions court order in Jodhpur which granted him bail in the 1998 blackbuck poaching case.
Salman was sentenced to five years in jail in the case on Thursday.
Immediately after his release at 5.35 pm on Saturday, 52-year-old Salman was driven under police escort to the Jodhpur airport from where he was flown to Mumbai in a chartered plane, a police official said.
Khan was allowed to leave the jail after the prison authorities received the bail documents, the official said. The actor's long-time bodyguard Shera accompanied him to the airport.
Hundreds of the actor's fans, who gathered outside the Jodhpur Central Jail, burst firecrackers and sang songs from his films as he walked out of the prison. The police had made tight security arrangements.
The fans, who were carrying garlanded posters of Salman, raised slogans like "Salman zindabad", "Salman tum sangharsh karo, hum tumhare saath hai (Salman, you continue your struggle, we are with you)". A few fans even chased the actor's cavalcade for some distance.
'Swag Se Karenge Salman Ka Swagat'
After landing at Santa Cruz airport in Mumbai, Salman was taken to his first-floor flat at Bandra's Galaxy Apartments where he reached at around 8 pm. His fans, who were there in front of his residence, burst crackers.

The delirious fans burst firecrackers and danced to the chants of "Swag Se Karenge Salman Ka Swagat" as the 52-year-old actor reached his residence. Fans danced amidst chants of "Welcome Bhai" and "Salman, Salman" as he made his way into his residence.
Soon after he reached his first-floor flat, Salman appeared in the balcony with his long-time bodyguard, Shera, and waived at the jubilant fans. He folded his hands, made a sign of "three" with his fingers and made another gesture to the fans, which meant "go home and sleep now".
Salman was accompanied by his father Salim Khan, mother Salma Khan and nephew Ahil, whom he held in his arms. The Dabangg actor's former girlfriend and Bollywood actor Katrina Kaif also paid a visit to him at his residence.
Salman enjoys huge fan following and many of his had come from far off places, stayed put in Bandra for three days, promising to return to their native places only after catching a glimpse of the actor.
Farhana Ahmed, a middle-aged woman one of whose ailing family members had once received financial assistance from a foundation set up by the actor, could not hold back her tears of joy when the news about Salman's release from the jail, broke out.
Saeed Shaikh, a resident of Ajmer in Rajasthan, who had been camping outside the Galaxy Apartments for the last three days, distributed sweets among the people gathered there.
Actor released on bond of Rs 50,000
In his order, Jodhpur District and Sessions Judge Ravindra Kumar Joshi allowed Salman's application for suspension of sentence for a month against his conviction.
Salman, who was lodged in the Jodhpur jail after his sentencing on Thursday, was granted bail on a bond of Rs 50,000 and two sureties of Rs 25,000 each, defense counsel Mahesh Bora said.
The judge asked the actor to appear before the court after a month on 7 May when it will hear his plea for suspension of sentence. He also directed Salman not to leave the country without the court's permission.
Bishnoi community to move Rajasthan High Court
Meanwhile, the Bishnoi community, which reveres the blackbuck, has decided to move the Rajasthan High Court challenging the bail granted to Salman, according to Ram Niwas, the secretary of the Bishnoi Tiger Force.

In its 10-page bail order, the court said the trial judge acquitted his Bollywood colleagues Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Neelam and Sonali Bendre and a local, Dushyant Singh, giving them the "benefit of the doubt" for the incident.
It also cited the differences in the post-mortem reports of the blackbucks with the first saying there was no gunshot injury while second stating that the animals were killed by gunshots.
Judge Joshi said during the trial, Salman had never misused any condition. He also said he was earlier granted bail in the Mathania Ghoda Farm case in which he was given a five-years jail term for killing a blackbuck. The high court later acquitted him.
Similarly, he was acquitted by the trial court in 2017 in the Bhawad poaching case in which he was accused of killing two chinkara gazelles, the court said.
It said the high court had also raised suspicion over the recovery of a Gypsy car, pellets, and arms from the actor in the two other poaching cases against him. The judge also said the complaint of lone eyewitness Poonam Chand on 2 October, 1998, was submitted to the court by the forest department six days later on 8 October.
Earlier in the day, the judge heard the arguments of the prosecution and the defense which lasted about an hour and pronounced the order around 3 pm, a defense counsel said.
Salman's sisters — Alvira and Arpita — were present during the hearing, besides Shera.
The actor was convicted by a trial court and sentenced to five years in prison for killing two blackbucks during the shooting of Hum Saath Saath Hain in Kankani village near Jodhpur on the night of 1 October 1998.
Judge Joshi transferred to Sirohi
In a late night development on Friday, an order was issued to transfer Ravindra Kumar Joshi to Sirohi, as part of an annual reshuffle. He was among 134 judges transferred by the high court registrar general.
The judge had on Friday reserved his decision on Salman's bail plea till Saturday after hearing arguments on the suspension of sentence and the bail application. While defense counsel Bora had argued for Khan's bail in the court on Friday, public prosecutor Pokar Ram Bishnoi had opposed the plea.
This was Salman's fourth stint in the Jodhpur jail, which also houses religious preacher Asaram Bapu, who has been accused of rape. He has spent a total of 20 days in the prison in 1998, 2006, 2007 and now, all for cases of poaching.
After Salman was granted bail, his friends and well-wishers from the film industry also expressed their happiness over the decision.
Director of Salman's upcoming film Race 3 Remo D'Souza told PTI, "I am happy that he has got bail. After working with him so closely I have become a huge fan of him not only as an actor but also as a human being."
"Almost 90 percent of the shoot for Race 3 is over and the remaining portions will mostly be shot in India," he said.
Producer of Race 3 Ramesh Taurani said he is "happy" that the actor has come out of the jail.
Salman's Dabangg co-actor Sonu Sood tweeted, "A Good deed is the best Prayer. Welcome brother Salman Khan."
“A Good deed is the best Prayer”. Welcome brother @BeingSalmanKhan . #WeSupportSalmanKhan

Thousands of fans lined up at the Mumbai Airport and outside his Bandra home on Saturday evening, carrying placards and banners in support of the Bollywood superstar, news agency IANS reported. 
A court in Jodhpur granted Salman bail on a bond of Rs 50,000 and two sureties of like amount, his lawyer Mahesh Bora said earlier in the day. 
The 52-year-old was sentenced to five years in prison on Thursday after being convicted for killing two blackbucks, an endangered antelope, in 1998.
Celebrations started soon after, with Salman’s fans bursting firecrackers outside Mumbai home and outside the court in Jodhpur. A large crowd has gathered in front of his Bandra home, Galaxy Apartments, waiting for the Bollywood superstar’s return.
Immediately after his release from Jodhpur Central Jail in the afternoon, Salman was driven under police escort to the airport, an official told PTI.
He walked out of the jail after the prison authorities received the court papers granting him bail, the official said.
His friends and well-wishers from the film industry as well as fans also took to Twitter to express their happiness.
Mahipal Bishnoi, the lawyer for the Bishnoi community, said Salman will not be able to leave the country without the court’s permission.
The next date of hearing is on May 7, when the court will hear his plea for appeal against the conviction.
The case against the Bollywood superstar was registered on the complaint of the Bishnoi community which reveres nature and considers killing animals a sin. The blackbuck is protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 and the punishment for hunting blackbuck can be up to six years. 
The actor killed the animals in Rajasthan’s Kankani village near Jodhpur during the shooting of film Hum Saath Saath Hain.
His co-stars and accused in the case — Saif Ali Khan, Neelam, Tabu and Sonali Bendre — were acquitted on the grounds of benefit of the doubt.
Salman, who was prisoner no. 106 in the jail, was visited by his sisters Alvira and Arpita as well as actor Preity Zinta.
District and sessions judge Ravindra Kumar Joshi pronounced the order in the post-lunch session after hearing arguments in the morning for nearly an hour.
The hearing on Salman’s bail plea was reserved on Friday after the prosecution sought time to peruse case papers.

The hearing
Salman’s counsel Bora moved an application in the district court that included as many as 54 grounds on which the lower court’s verdict was challenged. 
But public prosecutor Pokarram Bishnoi contended that this case was different. He said there were eyewitnesses who had recorded statements saying they had seen Salman shoot the blackbucks.
Bora told the sessions court that the trial court had ignored many facts in its decision. “The first post-mortem report of the blackbucks did not state that gun shot was the cause of death. No gun was seized from the accused.”
He pointed out that the investigation agency did not send the blackbuck skin for forensic examination. Only the bone was examined in which no bullet injury was found.
Bora also pointed out that Salman had fulfilled all orders of the court and so his sentence should be suspended.

 Salman Khan walked out of the Jodhpur Central Jail on Saturday after he was granted bail in the 1998 blackbuck poaching case on two bonds worth Rs 50,000 each. The 52-year-old actor cannot leave the country without the court's permission and will have to return to the court on May 7 for another hearing. Mahipal Bishnoi, the lawyer of Bishnoi community, told ANI that Salman Khan will have to submit two bonds of Rs 25 thousand each. They will now approach the Rajasthan High Court against bail granted to Salman Khan. Jodhpur District and Sessions Court Judge Ravindra Kumar Joshi had reserved Salman Khan's bail order for today. On Thursday, a Jodhpur court had convicted the Bollywood star for killing two blackbucks, an endangered species, 19 years ago while shooting for the film Hum Saath Saath Hain, and sentenced him to five years in jail. Hearing the verdict, Salman's fans cheered outside the court.   The other co-accused in the case -- actors Tabu, Saif Ali Khan, Neelam and Sonali Bendre -- were acquitted of all charges.   Meanwhile, Judge Joshi, who was scheduled to hear the actor's bail plea in the blackbuck poaching case, has been transferred by the Rajasthan High Court, along with 87 other district judges. The judge had asked for more documents, such as files of previous cases heard by Rural and High Courts before taking a decision on the actor's bail plea. Salman Khan's case was presented in the sessions court on Friday by senior advocate Mahesh Bora, who came with a 51-page bail application. He said the witnesses' statement should not be trusted in the case and argued that the actor should be given the benefit of the doubt. He also questioned why only Salman Khan had been convicted and all other co-accused acquitted. The Bollywood actors accused in this case allegedly went hunting on October 1-2 in 1998 outside a forest reserve near Kankani village in Jodhpur while shooting for Hum Saath Saath Hain.

The eyewitness account proves Salman Khan’s crime, the Prosecution read. After hearing both sides of the arguments, judge Ravindra Kumar Joshi shut his eyes for few minutes, smiled and said he needed some time.   According to sources, Salman Khan's counsel Hastimal Saraswat argued that the actor has never jumped bail in the past and has always appeared for trials in the case.   Ahead of the hearing, Salman Khan's sister Alvira and his long-time bodyguard Shera were at the court.

Second post-mortem report of blackbucks nailed Salman Khan: The second post-mortem report of the two blackbucks played a key role in proving that the animals had died of gunshots, as the trial court, while convicting Salman Khan, mentioned that it has been proved beyond doubt that the Bollywood superstar had shot them.
